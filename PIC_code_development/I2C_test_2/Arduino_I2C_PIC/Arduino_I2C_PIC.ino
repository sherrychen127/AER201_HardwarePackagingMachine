/* Arduino_I2C_PIC

 * Description: Demonstration of Arduino-PIC interfacing via I2C. In this program, the PIC outputs
 *              keypad data to the Arduino, which forwards it to a PC. If a triple-A sequence is
 *              given on the keypad, then the PIC will display data entered into the serial monitor
 *              on the character LCD. To open the serial monitor, go to Tools -> Serial Monitor.
 * Preconditions:
 *   1. PIC-Arduino link switches are enabled (ON) for A4 and A5 of the Arduino
 *      Nano (RC4 and RC3 for the primary PIC, respectively)
 *   2. PIC and Arduino Nano agree on the Arduino Nano's slave address (i.e. the
 *      same slave address is used in software)
 *   3. A PC is connected if the Arduino Nano serial monitor is to be used
