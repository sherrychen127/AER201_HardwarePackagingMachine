 * Description: Demonstration of communication between the primary PIC and the
 *              Arduino Nano, via I2C. To see the results on the Arduino Nano
 *              side, open the Arduino sample program Arduino_I2C_PIC. If the
 *              PIC receives a triple-A sequence from the keypad, it changes
 *              from being a transmitter to being a receiver that displays data
 *              on the character LCD. To change it back, reset the PIC.
 * 
 * Preconditions:
 *   1. PIC-Arduino link switches are enabled (ON) for A4 and A5 of the Arduino
 *      Nano (RC4 and RC3 for the primary PIC, respectively)
 *   2. PIC and Arduino Nano agree on the Arduino Nano's slave address (i.e. the
 *      same slave address is used in software)
 *   3. A PC is connected if the Arduino Nano serial monitor is to be used
