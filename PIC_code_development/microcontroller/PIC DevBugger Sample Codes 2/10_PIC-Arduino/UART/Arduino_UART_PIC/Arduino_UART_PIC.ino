 * Description: Sample program for arbitrary information exchange between
 *              the main PIC and the Arduino Nano
 * Preconditions:
 *   1.  Main PIC uses hardware UART
 *   2.  Arduino Nano uses software UART
 *   3.  The Co-processor is not driving lines on the UART bus (e.g. the UART jumpers are removed
 *   4.  The character LCD is in an Arduino Nano socket
 *   5.  PIC-Arduino link switches are enabled (ON) for D0 of the Arduino (the RX pin).
 *       However, make sure that neither of D0 and D1 are enabled (ON) while programming the Arduino Nano
